<h2>Trip</h2>

    <p>An incredible trip I did last summer was to Eastern Europe, in particular Bulgaria, Romania, and Serbia.<br>
        This trip lasted about two weeks and was done all by car, with Sofia, Bulgaria being the starting and ending point.<br>
        It was my first time in Eastern Europe and a post-soviet environment, so it was incredibly interesting and new to me.<br>
        The most memorable things from each country were: the ancient city of Plovdiv in Bulgaria, the Transfagarasan Highway in Romania, and the best meal of the entire trip in Belgrade, Serbia.

<h2> Link to my favorite restaurant</h2>
<a href="https://relaisdevenise.com/locations/new-york.php" target="_blank">Le Relais de Venise</a>
<br><br>
This restaurant only has one thing on its menu: l'entrecote wih Cafe de Paris sauce and frites. <br>
You may think: "why would I go to a place with only one thing on the menu?" My answer: "Fine, miss out on it!"<br>
The specialy sauce is buttery, aromatic and deliciously creamy. Their frites are cooked to perfection and crispy.<br>
I love dipping the frites in the sauce and enjoying the unique french feel of the restaurant.<br>
The best part? You get seconds! Did I mention a delicious salad also included as an appetizer? All for a fixed price of around $35 - not bad for NYC!<br>
Wine and dessert selections are also available at an additional cost. I personally love the profiteroles to finish such an incredible meal.<br>

Ok, it is not l'entrecote (and maybe not even my favorite dish since I love too many of them), but mac and cheese with hot dog wieners is a huge comfort food with me. I used to eat it often as a kid. I like the cheese to be mild and creamy and the hot dogs well cooked and almost crispy. I used to have it with some juice as a kid but now I'll have it with an ice cold beer.
